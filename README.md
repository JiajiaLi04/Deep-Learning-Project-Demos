1.A Multi-layer Percetron for Natural Language Processing 
===============
1.1 Overview
-------
This project will train a multi-layered perceptron for natural language processing. The task is to predict the next word in a sentence given a sequence of words. 
1.2 Network Architecture
-------
This project will train a neural language model using a multi-layered perceptron like figure 1. It receives 3 consecutive words as the input and aims to predict a distribution over the next word. The model is trained by using the cross-entropy criterion, which is equivalent to maximizing the probability it assigns to the target words in the training set.
